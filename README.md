### Features

- Get started with Parse.ly right away: the plugin automatically inserts the required metadata and JavaScript on all your published pages and posts.
- Choose what format the metadata takes, and whether logged-in users should be included in the analytics.
- Using it in a decoupled setup? Parse.ly adds metadata to the REST API output for pages, posts and optionally other object types.
- If you've purchased access to the Parse.ly API, add a widget to your site with article recommendations personalized to individual users.
